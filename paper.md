# Abstract

The ISO-27001 standard lists a host of requirements for implementing IT security in an organisation. Those requirements were not developed to help enable agile software development per se. This presents a challenge when adopting the standard in an organisation with a strong agile development culture: conforming to the standard can raise the cost and friction involved in releasing new services and features. This paper will explore which tools and processes can be used to mitigate the potential clash between the goals of standard compliance, and sustaining an agile development culture. The paper is organised as a case study at the University of Oslo's Center for IT, where the Services for Sensitive Data is in the process of adopting ISO-27001. _Keywords: devops, devsecops, secdevops, agile, ISO-27001_
